# RMS Discord Automation Ownership Standard

**Owner:** Angelea McCullough, Founder of RMS Global Publishing  
**Parent system:** RMS Fully Automated Intelligence System  
**Status:** Active

## Purpose

Reset Inner Circle Discord is the live community and activation node of the RMS ecosystem. It is not the authoritative store for creator rights, contracts, payments, unreleased masters, confidential metadata, or professional status. CreatorHub remains the secure system of record for those functions.

## Automation ownership

| System | Primary responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| RMS CreatorHub Discord App | RMS-specific slash commands, CreatorHub routing, public-safe RMS intelligence events, Marketplace/opportunity routing, RMS event status |
| Carl-bot Premium | Code of Law gate; CHOOSE YOUR SIGNALS; self roles; timed reaction roles; Advanced TagScript launchers; Levels/XP ambient progression; sticky messages; voice-role presence; transient auto-purge; verified temporary rooms; automod/Drama Watcher; greetings/farewell; Discord-native YouTube/Twitch alerts; suggestions; starboard; server discovery; private logging |
| Zapier | Cross-platform/calendar/Sheet triggers, approved announcements not owned by Carl, recaps, live-now signals not owned by Carl, cross-platform routing, private failure alerts |
| Tatsu | Verified event/contribution recognition only; not ambient message XP |
| Ticket Tool | Private support and escalation |
| VoiceMaster | Temporary-room fallback during Carl migration; retire if Carl temporary rooms pass verification |
| Statbot | Community analytics and server-health reporting |

No two systems should own the same routine notification. Routine `@everyone` pings are prohibited.

## Carl-bot Premium operating standard — 2026-10-01

Founder reported the Carl-bot subscription renewed for Reset Inner Circle. The latest dashboard screenshot still displayed **“Carlbot Premium — Not active”**, so the first live gate is to confirm the renewed Premium slot is actually attached to guild `1429398855681573038`. The desired state is version-controlled in `config/carl-premium-automation.json`.

Premium features are approved for use where they add measurable community value without making Carl-bot a single point of failure:

- **Levels & XP:** ambient participation progression only. Level roles are cosmetic/recognition roles and never imply RMS representation, professional clearance, licensing readiness, publishing status, employment, or authority.
- **Sticky Messages:** one concise sticky in high-value channels such as Code of Law, Main Arena, Power Hour, Sound Stage, Help Desk, and community feedback.
- **Voice-Role Links:** temporary presence roles for Sound Stage, Creator Showcase, Game Room, and Reset Media Studios. Never link authority/private-access roles.
- **Auto Purge:** only transient command/lobby/game chatter. Never purge event participation records, support history, moderation evidence, automation logs, rights/submission records, or decisions.
- **Timed Reaction Roles:** event/session identities expire automatically after the event window. The existing two-minute entry-gate close remains its own workflow.
- **Drama Watcher:** private moderator review channel only; never public-shame a member.
- **Personalize:** use the approved Reset/RS visual system without altering or duplicating the logo.
- **Premium limits:** reaction-role capacity is for clean self-service disciplines and notification roles, not role clutter; YouTube/Twitch capacity is limited to Founder-approved feeds.
- **Separate Farewell:** private operational/member-exit channel rather than public departure messaging.
- **Temporary Channels:** Carl becomes the preferred owner only after lifecycle tests pass; VoiceMaster becomes fallback-only and may then be retired.
- **Immediate Auto-feeds:** Carl owns Discord-native recurring reminders/feeds when designated. Zapier must not duplicate the same routine message.
- **Advanced TagScript:** event-launch and closeout helpers are leadership-only, privacy-safe, concise, and delete invocation where supported.
- **Starboard customization:** use a RESET creator-spotlight surface with a custom reaction threshold; recognition never equals professional approval.
- **Non-Carl ban logs / expanded weblogs:** route to private staff logs and retain cross-bot/human moderation evidence.

Carl standard features should also be fully hardened: welcome DM + gate flow, delayed/normal autoroles where appropriate, sticky self roles, automod, split private logging, suggestions with a decision log, granular command permissions, low-noise triggers, gaming alerts only when relevant, and Server Discovery.

### Prefix retirement

Carl’s dashboard currently warns that prefixes are retiring. Existing prefixes (`!`, `?`, `.flow`, `.reset`, `.rs`) are transitional only. Do not create new leadership workflows that depend on them. Prefer Carl’s slash-command surfaces and slash-accessible tag workflows where supported.

### Fail-safe

If Carl Premium or any Carl module is unavailable, public community access, `https://resetinnercircle.com/`, Discord native Events, the RMS CreatorHub slash-command bridge, and manual moderator operations must remain usable.

## Approved notification roles

- Live Events
- OmniLink Power Hour
- RESET Arena Games
- Platform Missions
- Creator Education
- Collaboration Calls

These roles are notification-only and must grant no elevated server permissions.

## RMS CreatorHub command surface

Target command set:

- `/portal` — CreatorHub and creator onboarding routing
- `/submit` — secure submission routing; never collect unreleased masters or private rights data in Discord
- `/marketplace` — RMS Marketplace routing
- `/sync` — licensing-readiness and Global Sync Catalog guidance; never promise placement
- `/rights` — Rights & Metadata Intelligence education and secure routing
- `/events` — RESET LIVE programming
- `/missions` — current Platform Missions
- `/support` — private support routing

## Public-safe RMS event contract

Approved event types:

- `rms.event.created`
- `rms.event.live`
- `rms.event.completed`
- `rms.mission.published`
- `rms.marketplace.public_listing`
- `rms.creator_showcase.approved`
- `rms.education.published`
- `rms.collaboration_call.published`
- `rms.sync_opportunity.public`
- `rms.system.alert`

Every event must carry a stable `correlation_id`. Consumers must suppress a repeat correlation ID to prevent duplicate posts and pings.

Public-safe fields are limited to event ID/type, title, public description/URL, Discord destination, notification role, schedule/status, approved image URL, correlation ID, and source system.

## Privacy boundary

Never publish or log in public Discord:

- passwords or authentication secrets
- banking/payment information
- government identification
- private contracts
- unreleased masters
- confidential rights splits or metadata
- private CreatorHub records
- OAuth, bot, Supabase, or Zapier credentials

Rights, contracts, submissions, payments, private metadata, and professional approval remain inside approved RMS secure systems.

## Event flow

Approved RMS event source → Zapier/RMS automation → Discord event/announcement → opt-in notification role → event calendar → reminder → live-now → event recap → operational analytics.

Carl-bot must not duplicate Zapier timing notifications. Carl may own a recurring Discord-native reminder/feed only when the automation registry assigns that exact signal to Carl; otherwise Zapier remains the owner. Discord native Events provide RSVP/calendar visibility. Carl Levels may provide ambient participation progression, while Tatsu remains limited to verified event/contribution recognition.

## Recognition standard

Tatsu recognition may reflect verified event completion, helpful creator feedback, completed collaborations, community support, event leadership, and completed Platform Missions.

Raw message volume must not be treated as meaningful achievement. Tatsu status must never imply RMS representation, publishing approval, licensing readiness, sync approval, Marketplace acceptance, or contract eligibility.

## Resilience

- Carl-bot failure: Discord Events and manual RMS operations remain available.
- Zapier failure: send one private alert to `automation-alerts`; use the manual event fallback and do not repeatedly retry public messages.
- Tatsu failure: record recognition manually.
- Failure of one automation provider must never make Reset Inner Circle unusable.

## Brand standard

Public presentation uses near-black, warm ivory, restrained rich gold, concise mobile-safe names, minimal emoji clutter, and premium ownership-first language. Music remains one creator pathway inside a multidisciplinary creator campus.

Permanent public metadata should identify **Angelea McCullough, Founder of RMS Global Publishing** where attribution is appropriate.

## Operating loop

**Signal → Activate → Participate → Verify → Recognize → Measure → Improve**
